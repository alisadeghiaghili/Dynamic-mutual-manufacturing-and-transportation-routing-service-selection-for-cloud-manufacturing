Recently, manufacturing ﬁrms and logistics service providers have been encouraged to deploy the most recent features of Information Technology (IT) to prevail in the competitive circumstances of manufacturing industries. Industry 4.0 and Cloud manufacturing (CMfg), accompanied by a service-oriented architecture model, have
been regarded as renowned approaches to enable and facilitate the transition of conventional manufacturing business models into more efﬁ
cient and productive ones. Furthermore, there is an aptness among the manufacturing and logistics businesses as service providers to synergize and cut down the investment and operational costs via sharing logistics ﬂeet and production facilities in the form of outsourcing and consequently increase their proﬁtability. Therefore, due to the Everything as a Service (XaaS) paradigm, efﬁcient service composition is known to be a remarkable issue in the cloud manufacturing paradigm. This issue is challenging due to the service composition problem’s large size and complicated computational characteristics. This paper has focused on the considerable number of continually received service requests, which must be prioritized and handled in the minimum possible time while fulﬁlling the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Considering the NP-hard nature and dynamicity of the allocation problem in the Cloud composition problem, heuristic and metaheuristic solving approaches are strongly
preferred to obtain optimal or nearly optimal solutions. This study has presented an innovative, time-efﬁcient approach for mutual manufacturing and logistical service composition with the QoS considerations. The method presented in this paper is highly competent in solving large-scale service composition problems time-efﬁciently while satisfying the optimality gap. A sample dataset has been synthesized to evaluate the outcomes of the developed model compared to earlier research studies. The results show the proposed algorithm can be applied to fulﬁll the dynamic behavior of manufacturing and logistics service composition due to its efﬁciency in solving time.
The paper has embedded the relation of task and logistic services for cloud service composition in solving algorithm and enhanced the efﬁ
ciency of resulted matched services. Moreover, considering the possibility of arrival of new services and demands into cloud, the proposed algorithm adapts the service composition algorithm.
